## Why This App Exists

My daughter's name is Luna. This app is named after her.

Luna was nonverbal until the age of seven.

First came loose words. Then single words that stuck. Then small sentences. Then full sentences. Then positions — opinions, preferences, needs made known with clarity and force.

The professionals who worked with us doubted my daughter would ever speak. This was not a speech delay. It was neurological. She was later diagnosed with autism. We were told to stick with one language — that trilingual was too much, that we needed to pick one and commit. So we did.

But here's what they didn't understand about us:

**We were never lacking. We just needed a different way in.**

Luna learns through pattern recognition and meaning-assigning. She decodes language the way she decodes the world — by watching, absorbing, finding the hidden structure underneath, and making it hers.

I know this because I learn the same way.

I was also speech delayed. Dyslexic. Neurodivergent. The world was too loud, too bright, too much — sensory overload with no name for it yet. My rescue was a book. *Flor de Maio* — a Brazilian children's story about a small butterfly born with a piece missing from her wing. She couldn't fly the way the others did. But she found her way, with help, with hope, and with stubborn joy. I didn't know it then, but that butterfly was me. It would also become my daughter.

When the words wouldn't come, I found other languages. I collected fallen leaves from plants and pretended I was doing magic. One day I even made rain. I picked up a guitar and played by ear — no lessons, no sheet music, just listening for the pattern underneath the sound. Then drums. Then keys. Music was another language I could decode without anyone's permission.

We go through life this way — decoding language, decoding music, decoding people, decoding everything. And we are fluent in all of it.

I now speak three languages and am learning Mandarin Chinese. Luna speaks full sentences, advocates for herself, and is now choosing — on her own terms — to learn Portuguese, Spanish, and Dutch.

Because her Vovó is meeting her halfway.

My mother speaks Portuguese and Spanish. She is moving to the Netherlands. Luna speaks English. And instead of waiting for someone to build the bridge between them, they are building it themselves — learning a little of each other's languages, word by word, sentence by sentence.

**And they understand each other.**

Luna makes her own greeting cards — by hand, with construction paper — and mails them to family. She designs the envelopes too. The lady at the post office already knows her handwriting.

A girl who once had no words now sends them through the mail.

I created the Luna app to honor my daughter's efforts and the few people who were there for us when we needed them most — when the world told us to expect less, and we refused.

This app teaches more than vocabulary. It teaches the words that keep you safe inside your own body — *I need a moment. I need to be alone. I need a hug. It's too loud. I don't have the words right now.* In all four languages. Because a child who can say what they need in any room, in any country, in any language — that child is free.

In kindergarten, a teacher looked at Luna and called her *Blue Butterfly Child*. She saw her before the systems did. Before the labels. Before anyone tried to train the butterfly out of her.

This app is for every child who was taught to perform the right answer before they learned to feel the real one. Luna was one of them. She learned obedience before she learned herself. It took years to undo that — years of her learning to look inward instead of outward for approval, to trust what her body was telling her, to understand that having needs is not a behavior problem.

Luna doesn't train obedience. Luna trains awareness. *What are you feeling? Where do you feel it? What do you need?* — and then it gives you the words. In whatever language you need them.

To have needs and not be able to communicate them is a kind of silence no child should carry. This app breaks that silence.

Dedicated to the unusually minded — young and old — and to the Blue Butterfly Child who showed me what courage actually looks like.

This app has music — soft, warm, a little quirky — because the world doesn't have to be silent to be gentle. Some of us need sound to feel safe. Some of us need quiet. Here, you choose. But when the music plays, it feels like the kind of book you fall asleep holding — not boring, just close.

The Luna moth was chosen with intention. It navigates by moonlight. It is quiet, beautiful, and determined. It finds its way in the dark. Just like her.
