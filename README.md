# 🦋 Luna

**A multilingual family bridge — built on the unusual path.**

*Unusual minds. Unusual paths. Unusual flight.*

Luna is a language learning app for the unusually minded.

Named after my daughter. Inspired by a butterfly that flies sideways.

## The Unusual Path

In the Brazilian children's book *Flor de Maio*, a small butterfly is born with a piece missing from her wing. She can't fly the way the others do. But she finds her way — with help, with hope, and with stubborn joy.

That story was my favorite as a child. I didn't know it then, but it was my story too.

My daughter Luna was nonverbal until seven. The professionals said to expect less. They said pick one language — trilingual was too much. They said a lot of things.

We didn't listen.

Luna now speaks in full sentences. She makes her needs known. And she chose — on her own terms — to learn Portuguese, Spanish, and Dutch so she could talk to her Vovó.

I speak three languages and am learning Mandarin Chinese. I was also speech delayed. Dyslexic. Sensory overload before I had a name for it. My rescue was a book — *Flor de Maio*. When the words wouldn't come, I found other languages: I played guitar by ear, then drums, then keys. No lessons, no sheet music — just pattern recognition applied to sound. We both learn the same way: by decoding patterns, assigning meaning, contextualizing everything. We were never lacking. We just needed a different way in.

**The unusual path (非常道) isn't the wrong path. It's the one that was always ours.**

## What Luna Does

Four languages. One family. Zero distance.

| Language | Who | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 🇬🇧 English | Luna | Her primary language |
| 🇳🇱 Dutch | Everyone | Vovó is moving to the Netherlands |
| 🇧🇷 Portuguese | Vovó | Her heart language |
| 🇪🇸 Spanish | Vovó | Her second language |

Luna and Vovó are meeting halfway — learning a bit of each other's languages, word by word, sentence by sentence. And they understand each other.

**Building bridges. Shortening distances.**

## Built For Us

This app is designed for neurodivergent learners — because that's who we are.

- 🧠 Pattern-based learning (decode, contextualize, acquire)
- 🌙 Sensory-friendly dark theme (moonlit palette, no harsh whites)
- 🎮 Rosetta Stone's immersion + actual translations + cultural context
- 🦋 Manga-style Luna moth mascot (teenager-friendly, not childish)
- 🔊 Audio for all four languages
- 🎵 Soft background music (optional — warm, gentle, never boring)
- 📖 Dutch cultural norms (because language without culture is just words)
- 💜 No streak anxiety, no guilt, no punishment for taking breaks
- 🤲 Left-hand / right-hand toggle (because we exist)
- 🧘 **Regulation & self-advocacy phrases** — learn to express your needs in any language

### Words That Matter

Most language apps teach you to order coffee. Luna teaches you to say:

> *"I need a moment."*
> *"I need to be alone."*
> *"I need a hug."*
> *"It's too loud."*
> *"I don't have the words right now."*
> *"I'm okay, I just need time."*

In English. In Dutch. In Portuguese. In Spanish. In whichever language you need — when you need it most.

Because the first language any of us need to learn is the one that lets us take care of ourselves.

### 🦋 The Blue Butterfly Child

In kindergarten, a Native American teacher looked at Luna and named her *Blue Butterfly Child*. She saw her before anyone had a word for what made her different.

This app is dedicated to every unusually minded child — young and old — who was taught to perform feelings instead of feeling them. Who learned the "right" answers before they learned their own. Who was trained to obey a bell instead of listening to their own body.

**Luna does the opposite.**

This app doesn't train compliance. It trains awareness. It asks: *What are you actually feeling? Where do you feel it? What do you need right now?* — and then gives you the words for it. In four languages.

### 🤖 AI Emotional Check-In

Luna includes a gentle, guided emotional check-in powered by AI — not therapy, not diagnosis, not a replacement for professional support. A conversation with the moth that helps you:

- **Notice** — *Is your body tight or loose? Fast or slow? Warm or cold?*
- **Name** — *That sounds like it might be frustration. Or maybe overwhelm. What feels closest?*
- **Need** — *What would help right now?* → Translates your need into all 4 languages
- **Navigate** — Links to real mental health resources for youth and families

For kids on the spectrum, even a full bladder can trigger a behavioral response when nobody's paying attention. This feature pays attention.

### 📚 Mental Health Resource Library

Vetted, accessible resources for neurodivergent youth and their families — because the systemic traps are real, and knowing where to turn shouldn't require a degree.

## The Moth

The Luna moth was chosen with intention. It navigates by moonlight. It is quiet, beautiful, and determined. It finds its way in the dark.

Luna gave me a latch hook of this moth. It hangs in our home.

Just like her — it's not decoration. It means something.
