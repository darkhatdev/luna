# 🌿 The Wholesome Spot — Sensory Garden Module

## A Place to Just Be

Not a lesson. Not a quiz. A place.

The Wholesome Spot is an interactive sensory garden inside the Luna app where users go when they need to regulate, decompress, or just exist in a gentle space — while their brain quietly absorbs language through texture, sound, and choice.

---

## The Space

A moonlit garden. Soft ambient sound. The Luna moth rests nearby — not guiding, just present.

The user's avatar (customizable — Luna, yourself, or a character you design) moves through the garden at their own pace. No timer. No score. No "you missed a day."

### Activities

| Activity | Sensory Channel | Sound | What It Teaches |
|---|---|---|---|
| 🍂 Raking leaves | Touch / rhythm | Crunch, scrape, sweep | Rough, dry, crispy |
| 🌱 Watering the garden | Visual / auditory | Pour, drip, splash | Wet, cool, fresh |
| 🪙 Dropping a coin in the wishing well | Auditory / anticipation | Clink... pause... splash | Wish, hope, deep |
| 🐱 Petting an animal | Touch / comfort | Purr, soft breathing, tail wag | Soft, warm, gentle |
| 🌸 Picking flowers | Visual / fine motor | Snap of stem, rustle | Smooth, delicate, fragrant |
| 🪨 Stacking stones | Balance / focus | Click, settle, balance | Heavy, solid, steady |
| 🕯️ Lighting a lantern | Visual / warmth | Match strike, gentle crackle | Bright, warm, safe |
| 🌧️ Sitting in the rain shelter | Auditory / regulation | Rain on roof, distant thunder | Loud, quiet, calm |
| 🦋 Watching butterflies | Visual / stillness | Wing flutter, breeze | Light, slow, free |
| 📝 Writing in the garden journal | Reflection / expression | Pencil scratch, page turn | Feelings vocabulary |
| 🎸 Playing guitar strings | Auditory / touch / rhythm | Nylon or steel (user chooses) | Gentle, bright, vibration |

### Animal Companion (User's Choice)

The user picks their animal. It stays with them in the garden. It responds to touch.

Options:
- 🐕 Dog (inspired by Pooja — default option with heart sweater)
- 🐈 Cat
- 🐇 Rabbit
- 🐢 Turtle
- 🦎 Gecko
- 🐦 Bird
- 🦋 Luna moth (always present regardless)

The animal isn't a reward. It's a companion. It doesn't leave if you stop playing.

## How It Works (No Pressure)

1. **Enter the garden** — avatar walks in, ambient sound begins
2. **Choose what to do** — tap any activity, or just sit
3. **Interact** — sound plays, word appears in chosen language
4. **Hear it** — TTS pronounces the word in all 4 languages (tap to cycle)
5. **Feel it** — optional gentle haptic feedback matches the texture
6. **Stay or leave** — no penalty for leaving, no reward for staying longer

### Sensory Settings (Always a Choice)
- 🔊 Garden ambient sound: ON / OFF
- 📳 Haptic feedback: ON / OFF
- 🎵 Background music: ON / OFF (separate from garden sounds)
- 🌙 Visual intensity: Low / Medium
- 🔤 Language display: One at a time / All four / Off

## 🎸 The Guitar Strings

A guitar sits in the corner of the garden. You can play it.

Tap the strings and they respond — real sampled sound, not synthesized. Strum or pluck. Watch them vibrate. Feel the haptic pulse match the note.

**Nylon strings** are the default. Warm, round, forgiving. No sharp edges. The sound that reaches sensory-sensitive ears without triggering defense. Classical guitar — the first language of someone who couldn't find words but could find music.

**Steel strings** are available. Brighter, sharper, more cutting. Some people need that clarity. Some days you want warmth. Some days you want brightness.

You choose. Always.

### The Visual

The strings visually vibrate when plucked — slow, visible oscillation that you can watch. For some of us, watching a string vibrate is the thing that calms the whole nervous system down. It's rhythmic, predictable, hypnotic in the gentlest way. The visual that changes you before the sound even registers.

### What the strings teach:

| String | Sound Word (EN) | Dutch | Portuguese | Spanish |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Low nylon | Deep | Diep | Profundo | Profundo |
| High nylon | Gentle | Zacht | Suave | Suave |
| Low steel | Bright | Helder | Brilhante | Brillante |
| High steel | Sharp | Scherp | Agudo | Agudo |
| Strum (all) | Vibration | Trilling | Vibração | Vibración |
| Muted | Quiet | Stil | Silêncio | Silencio |

The strings can also play along with the Strayheart melody — the user plucks while the song plays. They aren't performing. They're participating. The same way Luna filled in the last word of the song.

*"When the words wouldn't come, I found other languages. I played guitar by ear."*

## The Philosophy

Occupational therapists use sensory gardens. Speech therapists use vocabulary drills. Neither usually talks to each other.

The Wholesome Spot combines both:
- **Sensory integration** through interactive, self-directed activities
- **Vocabulary acquisition** through context, not memorization
- **Emotional regulation** through environmental choice and control
- **Agency** — the user picks everything: animal, activity, language, volume, duration

This isn't a lesson with a garden theme. It's a garden where language happens to grow.

## Connection to the Strayheart Module

When a user finishes the Strayheart breathing exercise and reaches the "Belonging" state, the garden is where they land. The transition:

```
Strayheart Animation → "I belong here" → Garden fades in
The moth is already there. The animal companion is waiting.
The rain shelter is available if it was "too loud."
```

The garden is the destination. Strayheart is the journey there.

## Why This Matters

For kids like Luna — who used to head-bang because she couldn't communicate what she felt — the problem was never behavior. It was sensation without language.

A full bladder is a sensation. Itchy clothes are a sensation. Too-bright lights are a sensation. If you can't say "this is itchy" or "I need quiet" or "my body feels heavy," you don't have behavior problems. You have a vocabulary gap.

The Wholesome Spot closes that gap — not by drilling words, but by letting kids feel the texture, hear the sound, and discover the word at the same time. In four languages. So they can tell anyone, anywhere, in any language:

*"This is how I feel."*

*"We were never lacking. We just needed a different way in."*
