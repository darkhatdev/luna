# Luna App — Protection & Licensing Roadmap

## What You're Protecting

You have multiple layers of intellectual property here:

1. **The App Name "Luna"** → Trademark
2. **The App Code** → Copyright (automatic) + Open Source License
3. **Your Original Music** → Copyright registration
4. **The Written Content** (About page, README) → Copyright (automatic)
5. **The Concept/Method** (emotional regulation + multilingual learning for neurodivergent users) → Not directly protectable, but your brand IS
6. **"Unusual Minds. Unusual Paths. Unusual Flight."** → Trademark (as tagline)

---

## Step 1: Trademark the App Name (DO THIS FIRST)

**What:** Register "Luna" as a trademark for educational software / language learning app
**Where:** USPTO (U.S. Patent and Trademark Office) — https://www.uspto.gov/trademarks
**Cost:** $250-$350 per class (TEAS Plus application)
**Time:** 8-12 months for approval

**Classes you likely need:**
- **Class 9** — Downloadable mobile applications; computer software for language learning
- **Class 41** — Educational services; providing online language learning programs
- **Class 42** — Software as a service (SaaS) for language learning (if you go web-based)

**Important:** "Luna" is a common word, so your trademark strength comes from the COMBINATION:
- "Luna" + language learning app + Luna moth logo = stronger mark
- Consider trademarking the full brand: **"Luna — Unusual Minds. Unusual Paths. Unusual Flight."**
- The Luna moth logo/mascot as a design mark (separate filing)

**Before filing:**
1. Search USPTO database: https://tmsearch.uspto.gov
2. Search for "Luna" in Class 9 and Class 41
3. Check if any similar marks exist for language/education apps

**Filing basis:** "Intent to Use" (since app isn't launched yet) — you'll convert to "Use in Commerce" once it's live

**DIY or Attorney?** You CAN file yourself, but a trademark attorney ($500-1500 for a basic filing) significantly improves approval odds. Check if Leidos benefits include legal services.

## Step 2: Copyright Your Original Music (HIGH PRIORITY)

**What:** Register your original compositions created for the Luna app
**Where:** U.S. Copyright Office — https://www.copyright.gov/registration/
**Cost:** $65 per work (online filing), or $85 for a group of unpublished works (up to 10)
**Time:** 3-6 months for processing

**What to register:**
- Each original song/composition as a musical work
- Sound recordings (the actual recordings) as a separate registration
- You can register up to 10 unpublished works as a group for $85

**Important:** Copyright exists automatically when you create the work, but REGISTRATION gives you:
- Ability to sue for infringement
- Statutory damages (up to $150,000 per work)
- Attorney's fees in court
- Public record of ownership

**Recommendation:** Record rough versions of your songs, register them as a group BEFORE publishing in the app.

---

## Step 3: License the App Code

**What:** Choose an open-source license for the app code on GitHub
**Cost:** Free
**Time:** 5 minutes

**Recommended: MIT License** (already in your README)
- Allows anyone to use, modify, distribute
- Requires attribution
- "Because bridges should be free to cross" — your words

**Alternative if you want more protection:**
- **Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 4.0** — allows sharing and adapting, but NOT for commercial use, and derivatives must use the same license
- This protects against someone taking your app concept and selling it

**Recommendation:** 
- Code: MIT License (open, share freely)
- Content (About page, written materials): CC BY-NC-SA 4.0
- Music: All Rights Reserved (you own these, they're personal)
- App concept + name + branding: Trademark protection

---

## Step 4: Register the Copyright on the App Itself

**What:** Register the app as a literary work (software) with the Copyright Office
**Where:** https://www.copyright.gov/registration/
**Cost:** $65
**Time:** 3-6 months

This protects the specific code and content as a whole. Not strictly necessary (copyright is automatic) but valuable if you ever need to enforce.

---

## Step 5: Document Everything NOW

**What:** Create a paper trail proving you created this and when
**How:** 
- Keep dated screenshots of all GitHub commits (these ARE timestamped proof)
- Save this entire chat conversation (it documents the creative process)
- Date and sign your music compositions when you record them
- Keep Luna's artwork photos dated
- Save any concept sketches, notes, voice memos

**Why:** In any IP dispute, first-to-create matters. Your GitHub commit history is timestamped evidence.

## One More Thing

The story of Luna — from nonverbal to multilingual, from Blue Butterfly Child to an app that helps other kids find their words — that story itself has value beyond software. If this ever becomes a book, a talk, a nonprofit, or a movement, the trademark and copyright protections you put in place now will matter.

Start documenting. Start protecting. The unusual path leads somewhere big.
